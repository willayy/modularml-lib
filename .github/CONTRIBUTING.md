# Developers tech-tack

## Compiler
modularml is written in C/C++ and uses [GCC 14+](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-14/) as the compiler and uses C/C++ standards c++20 and c17 which you can read more about [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Standards.html). You can also use Clang but with less support.

## Build system
modularml uses [CMake 3+](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.31/) as the build system. You can read more about how to use CMake [here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.31/guide/tutorial/index.html).

## Documentation
modularml uses Doxygen for documentation. You can read more about how to use Doxygen [here](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/index.html). Doxygen will be generated by CMake when building the project.

## Testing
modularml uses ctest please refer to [CMake](#build-system) for more information.

## Coverage report generation
modularml uses [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) for coverage report generation. You can read more about how to use gcov [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html).

## ML model weight standard
modularml uses the [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) format for storing ML model weights. You can read more about the ONNX format [here](https://onnx.ai/onnx/intro/).

## IWYU (include what you use)
modularml optionally uses [IWYU](https://include-what-you-use.org/) for include management. You can read more about IWYU [here](https://include-what-you-use.org/).

## Version control and remote repository storage
modularml uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as the version control system and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en) as the remote repository storage.

## Formatting
modularml uses Clang format with 2 spaces.

## Commits
Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

A git message is 72 chars max, if your commit is longer than this you have probably
made too many changes for them to be a reasonable commit. This also gives you an idea
of how many changes should be included in a singe commit. One file per commit (probably even
one function changed per commit) is a good heuristic to go by.

### HOTFIX commits
should be prefixed with `HOTFIX: ` and should be used for commits that are
critical to the project and needs to be deployed as soon as possible. This is can be done on prod branches by the repo admin.

## Pull-requests
Create a PR before you merge a branch to main, you can read about branch protection rules here [here](https://github.com/willayy/modularml/settings/rules/3452750).

## Releases
Releases are done by the repo admin weekly on Fridays before 23:59 UTC+1.

## Version names
Version names in this project follows the rules of semantic versioning which in summary is:

Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the:
* **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
* **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
* **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** format.
